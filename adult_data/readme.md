## Data ##

The data is a small sample of the 1990 US census, containing a few socioeconomic columns and whether the subject made more or less than $50k a year. I obtained it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).

## Modelling ##

The idea is to model whether a subject makes more than $50k or not.
