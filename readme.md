## README ##

This is a repository where I plan to put some small data science projects I do. Things like collecting, exploring or modelling small datasets. I will be using Python 3 Jupyter notebooks and libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib, Numpy, sklearn, etc.

Note that these will rarely be finished projects, but rather me just fulfilling my own curiosity. 

### Projects ###

* **adult data**: the data is a sample from the 1990 US census with some socioeconomic features including whether they make more than $50k a year or not. The later is what I try to predict with my models.

* **countries health spending**: here I collect some data about countries from the world bank and then analyze it. The features I collect are GDP, population, health expenditure per capita and life expectancy. Then I do a bit of exploratory data analysis on the collected data.
