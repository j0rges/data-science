## Data ##

I collect GDP, population, health expenditure per capita and life expectancy for countries through the world banks api. Scraped the data about the continent from [world atlas](https://www.worldatlas.com/cntycont.htm). However, because the world bank generally works in terms of territories, whilst world atlas works in terms of countries, there is some gaps.
